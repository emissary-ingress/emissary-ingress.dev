items:
  - version: 1.13.10
    date: '2021-07-27'
    notes:
      - title: Fix for CORS origins configuration on the Mapping resource
        type: bugfix
        body: "Fixed a regression when specifying a comma separated string for <code>cors.origins</code> on the <code>Mapping</code> resource"
        docs: topics/using/cors
      - title: New Envoy-configuration snapshots for debugging
        body: "Envoy-configuration snapshots get saved (as <code>ambex-#.json</code>) in <code>/ambassador/snapshots</code>. The number of snapshots is controlled by the <code>AMBASSADOR_AMBEX_SNAPSHOT_COUNT</code> environment variable; set it to 0 to disable. The default is 30."
        type: change
        docs: running/environment/
      - title: Optionally remove ratelimiting for Envoy reconfiguration
        body: "Set <code>AMBASSADOR_AMBEX_NO_RATELIMIT</code> to <code>true</code> to completely disable ratelimiting Envoy reconfiguration under memory pressure. This can help performance with the endpoint or Consul resolvers, but could make OOMkills more likely with large configurations."
        type: change
        docs: running/environment/

  - version: 1.13.9
    date: '2021-06-30'
    notes:
      - title: Fix for TCPMappings
        body: "Fixed a bug which caused $productName$ to generate invalid Envoy configuration when two TCPMappings were deployed with the same port, but different host."
        type: bugfix
        docs: topics/using/tcpmappings/
  - version: 1.13.8
    date: '2021-06-08'
    notes:
      - title: Fix Ambassador Cloud Service Details
        body: "Fixed a bug that occasionally caused missing version information for a service in the Ambassador Service Catalog, especially in clusters with high pod churn."
        type: bugfix
        docs: tutorials/getting-started/#3-connect-your-cluster-to-ambassador-cloud
        image: ./edge-stack-1.13.8-cloud-bugfix.png
      - title: Improved Argo Rollouts Experience with Ambassador Cloud
        body: "Ambassador Agent now reports the state of ArgoCD configurations and Deployments in order to provide proper configurations to the users while setting up the Argo Rollouts feature."
        type: feature
        docs: https://www.getambassador.io/docs/argo
  - version: 1.13.7
    date: '2021-06-03'
    notes:
      - title: JSON logging support
        body: "An <code>AMBASSADOR_JSON_LOGGING</code> environment variable has been added. When set to <code>true</code> JSON format will be used for most of the control plane logs. Some (but few) logs from <code>gunicorn</code> and the Kubernetes <code>client-go</code> package will still be in text only format."
        image: ./edge-stack-1.13.7-json-logging.png
        docs: topics/running/running/#log-format
        type: feature
      - title: Consul resolver bugfix with TCPMappings
        body: "The TCPMapping has the ability to specify a resolver, however the <code>ConsulResolver</code> did not work properly with it. It now utilizes the Consul Connect service discovery instead of falling back to attempting to register an arbitrary endpoint."
        image: ./edge-stack-1.13.7-tcpmapping-consul.png
        docs: topics/running/resolvers/#the-consul-resolver
        type: bugfix
      - title: Memory usage calculation improvements
        body: "The internal memory usage calculation that $productName$ performs has been updated to exclude cache memory. This now matches how the kernel OOMKiller calculates memory and should avoid situations where Envoy updates are throttled unnecessarily."

        docs: topics/running/scaling/#inspecting-ambassador-performance
        type: change

    notes:
      - title: Envoy 1.15.5
