changelog: https://github.com/emissary-ingress/emissary/blob/$branch$/CHANGELOG.md
items:
  - version: 1.13.7
    date: '2021-06-03'
    notes:
      - title: Ambassador JSON logging support
        body: "An <code>AMBASSADOR_JSON_LOGGING</code> environment variable has been added. When set to <code>true</code> JSON format will be used for most of the control plane logs. Some (but few) logs from <code>gunicorn</code> and the Kubernetes <code>client-go</code> package will still be in text only format."

        docs: topics/running/running/#log-format
        type: feature
      - title: Consul resolver bugfix with TCPMappings
        body: "The TCPMapping has the ability to specify a resolver, however the <code>ConsulResolver</code> did not work properly with it. It now utilizes the Consul Connect service discovery instead of falling back to attempting to register an arbitrary endpoint."

        docs: topics/running/resolvers/#the-consul-resolver
        type: bugfix
      - title: Memory usage calculation improvements
        body: "The internal memory usage calculation that Emissary Ingress and Ambassador Edge Stack perform has been updated to exclude cache memory. This now matches how the kernel OOMKiller calculates memory and should avoid situations where Envoy updates are throttled unnecessarily."

        type: change
  - version: 1.13.4
    date: '2021-05-13'
    notes:
      - title: Envoy 1.15.5
        body: Emissary Ingress 1.13.4 and Edge Stack 1.13.4 have been updated to Envoy 1.15.5, which addresses a high severity security vulnerability (CVE-2021-29492). Edge Stack and Emissary Ingress can now be configured to reject client requests that contain escaped slashes.
