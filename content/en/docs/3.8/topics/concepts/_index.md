This section of the documentation introduces core concepts of Kubernetes and Emissary-ingress. Kubernetes and microservices introduce a number of new, powerful paradigms for software development, and Ambassador takes full advantage of these paradigms.

This section discusses:

* [The Kubernetes Network Architecture and Ambassador](kubernetes-network-architecture)
* [The Ambassador Operating Model: Continuous Delivery, GitOps, and Declarative Configuration](gitops-continuous-delivery)
* [Progressive Delivery](progressive-delivery)
* [Microservices API Gateways](microservices-api-gateways)
