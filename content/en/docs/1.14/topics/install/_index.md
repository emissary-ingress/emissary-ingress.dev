## <img class="os-logo" src="../../images/apple.png"/> Install for macOS
1. (1a) [Download the `edgectl` installer](https://metriton.datawire.io/downloads/darwin/edgectl)
 or (1b) download it with a curl command:

    ```
    sudo curl -fL https://metriton.datawire.io/downloads/darwin/edgectl -o /usr/local/bin/edgectl && sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/edgectl
    ```

    If you decide to download the file with (1b), you may encounter a security block. To continue, use this procedure:
    * Go to **System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General**.
    * Click the **Open Anyway** button.
    * On the new dialog, click the **Open** button.

2. Run the installer with `edgectl install`

3. The installer will provision a load balancer, configure TLS,
and provide you with an `edgestack.me` subdomain. The `edgestack.me` subdomain
allows Ambassador Edge Stack to automatically provision TLS and HTTPS
for a domain name, so you can get started right away.

4. [Set up Service Catalog](../../tutorials/getting-started/#3-connect-your-cluster-to-ambassador-cloud) to view all of your service metadata in Ambassador Cloud.

## <img class="os-logo" src="../../images/kubernetes.png"/> Install via Kubernetes YAML
Kubernetes via YAML is the most common approach to install Emissary,
especially in production environments, with our default, customizable manifest.
So if you want complete configuration control over specific parameters of your
installation, use the [manual YAML installation method](yaml-install).

## <img class="os-logo" src="../../images/helm-navy.png"/> Install via Helm
Helm, the package manager for Kubernetes, is another popular way to install
Emissary through the pre-packaged Helm chart. Full details, including
the differences for Helm 2 and Helm3, are in the [Helm instructions.](helm/)

## <img class="os-logo" src="../../images/docker.png"/> Install Locally on Docker
The Docker install will let you try the Emissary locally in seconds,
but is not supported for production workloads. [Try Emissary on Docker.](docker/)

## Install via the Ambassador Operator
The Ambassador Operator automates installs (day 1 operations) and
updates (day 2 operations), among other actions. To use the powerful Emissary
Operator, [follow the Ambassador Operator instructions](aes-operator).

## Install on Bare Metal
If you don't have a load balancer in front of your Kubernetes, the Bare Metal
installation mechanism can still be used to expose Emissary.
We've got [instructions for bare metal installations](bare-metal) including exposing
Emissary via a NodePort or the host network.

## Upgrade Options
If you already have an existing installation of Ambassador Edge Stack or
Emissary, you can upgrade your instance:

1. [Upgrade to Ambassador Edge Stack from Emissary](upgrade-to-edge-stack/).
2. [Upgrade your Emissary instance](upgrading/) to the latest version.

## Container Images
Although our installation guides will favor using the `docker.io` container registry,
we publish Ambassador Edge Stack and Emissary releases to multiple registries.

Starting with version 1.0.0, you can pull the `ambassador` and `aes` images from any of the following registries:
- `docker.io/datawire/`
- `quay.io/datawire/`
- `gcr.io/datawire/`

We want to give you flexibility and independence from a hosting platform's uptime to support
your production needs for Ambassador Edge Stack or Emissary. Read more about
[Running Emissary in Production](../running).

# Whatâ€™s Next?
Emissary has a comprehensive range of [features](/features/) to
support the requirements of any edge microservice. To learn more about how Emissary works, along with use cases, best practices, and more,
check out the [Welcome page](/docs/emissary/) or read the [Emissary
Story](../../about/why-ambassador).
